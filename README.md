# Zyin's HUD

This is a mod which adds various utilities and enhancements to make your life easier. Designed with the advanced Minecrafter in mind. It adds your coordinates, a compass, a clock, calculates distances, shows nearby players, shows unsafe areas, shows potion durations, quick deposit, eating aid, ender pearl aid, potion aid, torch aid, weapon swapper, an fps counter, displays animal info, item selector, health monitor, and dynamically displays your equipment's durability. Any one of these features can be disabled. It works in both single player and multiplayer servers.

I'm releasing this as open source. Make sure to check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Zyin055/zyinhud). If you happen to use the code in any way make sure to send me a PM because I'd love to see what you make with it.

See this mod on the Minecraft Forums [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1986419-164forgesspsmp-zyins-hud/) or on CurseForge [here](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/zyins-hud/). These are the only two sites I post new downloads to.
